        <h2>Marks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Areas: each piece of data refers to one of the 50 states on the map,
            an area, and what they would look like in 2016 if just women voted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lines: the line bar above the map uses a line mark to show the
            distribution of votes between Clinton and Trump.
          </li>
          <li>
            Points: the data showing the electoral vote results at the bottom of
            the visualization uses points to represent the data. Each point
            represents a candidate that was elected.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Channels</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Color: color is used here to represent the two political parties.
            Blue shows the states and number of people that voted for Clinton,
            red shows the states and number of people who voted for Trump, and
            the one state with red and blue shows a 50-50 split. The colors also
            distinguish which party won the statewide and district elections in
            Maine and Nebraska.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: the colors here represent candidates of opposing
                parties, a categorical attribute. This is a good choice because
                the same colors are used in the real world to represent the same
                thing â€” red for the Republican party and blue for the Democratic
                party. This makes the data easy to understand.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Length: along with color, length is used in the line bar to show
            that way more women voted blue than red in 2016.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: the length here represents the counted of people that
                voted a certain way, a quantitative attribute. This is a good
                choice because we associate longer lengths with a larger amount,
                so this data is easy to interpret and read.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Shape: the shape of each state helps the user distinguish between
            different states, which are different data points.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: the border of each area represents a specific state.
                This is a good choice because the shape is the most commonly
                used channel to distinguish between different states or
                countries on maps, and is easily recognizable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Colormap</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Categorical colormap: there are only two colors used in this
            visualization, and they clearly represent two different categories.
            The two hues are red and blue, and they have the same saturation and
            are very different from each other.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: like the color channel, this colormap represents
                candidates of opposing parties which is a categorical attribute.
                The red represents a Republican candidate, Trump, and the blue
                represents a Democratic candidate, Clinton. This is a good
                choice because it makes it clear that the data wants to show two
                different categories.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>Mark</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Points: small dots are used here to represent the score of batted
            balls based on the exit velocity and the launch angle.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Channels</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Position: in this visualization, both horizontal and vertical
            positions are used. It shows the effect that exit velocity and
            launch angle have on scoring value.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: the x-axis represents exit velocity which is a
                quantiative attribute. This is a good choice because it relates
                to how humans perceive speed and distance. When the velocity is
                higher, the ball will tend to travel farther, which makes sense
                with this graph as well, since a higher velocity is further away
                on the x-axis.
              </li>
              <li>
                Attribute: the y-axis represents launch angle, which is a
                divergent attribute. This is a good choice for a similar reason
                to the x-axis attribute, as balls launched with a larger angle
                go higher into the air, while balls launched with a lower angle
                will go to the ground.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Color: color is used here to represent whether the scores are below
            average, above average, or just average.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: the colors here represent scoring value, a
                quantitative attribute. I think this is a good choice, because
                there are three distinct colors for three distinct sections:
                below average, average, and above average. Within those
                sections, the colors also vary by saturation, where higher
                scores are darker and lower scores are lighter. However, one
                thing I would change is using white is the middle-point color.
                It would be better to use something more readable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Colormap</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Divergent colormap: there are two extremes here, the lowest score
            for below average which is the darkest purple, and the highest score
            for above average which is the darkest orange. In between those
            values, the saturation gets lighter starting from the left until it
            reaches the midpoint, and then the saturation gets darker further to
            the right.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: like the color channel, the divergent colormap
                represents scoring value which is a quantitative attribute. This
                is a good choice because it clearly shows how there is a range
                of scores and clearly communicates an order within the data.
              </li>

          Comparing the order sizes of customers divided into four different
          segments based on demographic data. The x-axis shows income in
          Brazilian currency, and the y-axis represents the food order size by
          <br />
          using the cost of the order in Brazilian currency.

      <div class="col">
        <h2>Marks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Points: the graph uses dots to represent the customers of the food
            ordering app.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lines: we used a line mark to show a line of best fit, to better
            understand the trend of the data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Channels</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Position: the graph has an x-axis and a y-axis. The x-axis
            represents the income in Brazilian currency, and the y-axis
            represents the food order size, but we show this using the cost of
            the order.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: the x-axis represents income in Brazilian currency,
                which is a quantitative attribute. This is a good choice,
                because as we go further to the right, the price increases. In
                addition, combined with the color, we can easily see where each
                new segment of people begins as the income increases to the
                right.
              </li>
              <li>
                Attribute: the y-axis represents food order size in terms of the
                cost of the order, which is also a quantiative attribute. This
                is a good choice because as we go furhter up the axis, the price
                increases, which also aligns with common sense. We decided to
                use price here to stay consistent with the x-axis unit. It's
                also hard to quantify food order size, as someone could order 4
                really small items while another person orders 1 large item. So,
                this was a good way to make everything uniform.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Color: color is used here to show which of the four different
            segments each person belongs to. The segments were chosen based on
            income.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: color is used here to represent four different groups
                of people, which is a categorical attribute. This is a good
                choice because it's clear that each color represents something
                different. The color of the line is also very different from the
                four segments, which makes the graph more readable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Colormap</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Categorical colormap: there are four colors being used here, and
            each one is very distinct. The colors are all around the same
            saturation, so it's clear they all represent a different category.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Attribute: like the color channel, the colormap represents four
              different groups of people based on income, a categorical
              attribute. This is a good choice because it makes the different
              groups very clear. We can easily discern people of different
              segments and their spending habits by looking at order size.
