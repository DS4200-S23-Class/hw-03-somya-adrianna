        <h2>Mark</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Areas: each piece of data refers to one of the 50 states on the map,
            an area, and what they would look like in 2016 if just women voted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lines: the line bar above the map uses a line mark to show the
            distribution of votes between Clinton and Trump.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Channel</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Color: color is used here to represent the two political parties.
            Blue shows the states and number of people that voted for Clinton,
            red shows the states and number of people who voted for Trump, and
            the one state with red and blue shows a 50-50 split.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: the colors here represent candidates of opposing
                parties, a categorical attribute. This is a good choice because
                the same colors are used in the real world to represent the same
                thing â€” red for the Republican party and blue for the Democratic
                party. This makes the data easy to understand.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Length: along with color, length is used in the line bar to show
            that way more women voted blue than red in 2016.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: the length here represents the counted of people that
                voted a certain way, a quantitative attribute. This is a good
                choice because we associate longer lengths with a larger amount,
                so this data is easy to interpret and read.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Shape: the shape of each state helps the user distinguish between
            different states, which are different data points.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: the border of each area represents a specific state.
                This is a good choice because the shape is the most commonly
                used channel to distinguish between different states or
                countries on maps, and is easily recognizable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Colormap</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Categorical colormap: there are only two colors used in this
            visualization, and they clearly represent two different categories.
            The two hues are red and blue, and they have the same saturation and
            are very different from each other.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: like the color channel, this colormap represents
                candidates of opposing parties which is a categorical attribute.
                The red represents a Republican candidate, Trump, and the blue
                represents a Democratic candidate, Clinton. This is a good
                choice because it makes it clear that the data wants to show two
                different categories.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <h2>Mark</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Points: small dots are used here to represent the score of batted
            balls based on the exit velocity and the launch angle.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Channel</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Position: in this visualization, both horizontal and vertical
            positions are used. It shows the effect that exit velocity and
            launch angle have on scoring value.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: the x-axis represents exit velocity which is a
                quantiative attribute. This is a good choice because it relates
                to how humans perceive speed and distance. When the velocity is
                higher, the ball will tend to travel farther, which makes sense
                with this graph as well, since a higher velocity is further away
                on the x-axis.
              </li>
              <li>
                Attribute: the y-axis represents launch angle, which is a
                divergent attribute. This is a good choice for a similar reason
                to the x-axis attribute, as balls launched with a larger angle
                go higher into the air, while balls launched with a lower angle
                will go to the ground.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Color: color is used here to represent whether the scores are below
            average, above average, or just average.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: the colors here represent scoring value, a
                quantitative attribute. I think this is a good choice, because
                there are three distinct colors for three distinct sections:
                below average, average, and above average. Within those
                sections, the colors also vary by saturation, where higher
                scores are darker and lower scores are lighter. However, one
                thing I would change is using white is the middle-point color.
                It would be better to use something more readable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Colormap</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Divergent colormap: there are two extremes here, the lowest score
            for below average which is the darkest purple, and the highest score
            for above average which is the darkest orange. In between those
            values, the saturation gets lighter starting from the left until it
            reaches the midpoint, and then the saturation gets darker further to
            the right.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Attribute: like the color channel, the divergent colormap
                represents scoring value which is a quantitative attribute. This
                is a good choice because it clearly shows how there is a range
                of scores and clearly communicates an order within the data.
              </li>
